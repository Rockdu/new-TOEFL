	The passage and the lecture are holding some contradictory opinions of some general beliefs about elephants. The passage points out that the elephant is good at art and fear of mice, and old elephant seems aware of their death. However, the lecture claims that most of the points are just misunderstandings. 
	First, the passage holds the point that old elephants are aware of their death, since the bones of elderly found near water indicates that the elderly leave from the herds and die alone. The lecture refutes the idea by stating that old elephants choose to the herds simply because of their decreasing chewing ability. Due to this factor, they have to find some soft vegetation, which usually grows near water.
	Second, although the passage asserts that elephants are good and the only animal artists and are able to hold a brush with their trunk to paint patterns like flowers and other elephants, the lecture holds a different view that the painting results from the trainer rather than elephant itself. The trainers touch their ears to train them to remember specific patterns, so the elephants are probably not aware of what they've painted.
	Third, contrary to the belief by the passage that elephants are fear of small mammals like mice, the lecture regards it as a sort of unfamiliarity. The elephants look like they're fear of mice because they're not familiar with mice, which can be proved by elephants in the zoo where elephants don't present as they are afraid of mice.

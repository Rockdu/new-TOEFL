	When it comes to the development of a company, there always lies a controversy that what kind of investment should the company pay attention to. Some people claim that the most important investment is to improve the efficiency and proficiency of its employees. Although it sounds plausible, the company obviously has to take more than employees into consideration, for example, the advertising and products.
	Admittedly, investment on employees is a key point towards success for a company. The efficiency will be improved, followed by increased productivity. However, it could also be a risky try. The problems occur when some staff are well developed and prone to move to another company to seek for better opportunities. In this case, the investment is just in vain, or even worse when it benefits the opponents of the company. In a nutshell, pay for the development of employees is absolutely not the only important point.
	Apart from the ability of employees, the company have to attach great importance to advertising work, because only through the advertisement can a consumer get to know the company's products and decide if it worths the price. In order to attract a large number of consumers for the profit purpose, an impressive advertisement is mostly needed, which actually demands a considerable budget. 
	The company should also invest in its own products as well as related services. Because it's the product itself that is the core of a company since it's exactly where the company makes most of the profits and what consumers really care about. Without the quality of the products, no advertisement would work and no matter how efficient and capable the employees could be, profits simply never come because nobody would like to pay for a terrible product. 
	Generally speaking, except for the investment in the capability of employees, the advertising and the quality of the products are also crucial factors concerning the success of a company.

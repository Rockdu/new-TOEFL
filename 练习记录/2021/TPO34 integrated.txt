Both the reading and the lecture are talking about the reasons for the extinction of Steller's sea cows around 1768. While the reading believes that native overhunting, decreasing number of kelps and European fur traders are the main reasons, the lecture holds a different view that there are some problems with these theories. 
	Firstly, the author of the reading passage thinks the number of sea cows was diminished because they were overhunted by native Siberian people as their food. However, the lecturer holds a different view that the sea cows are so massive that only a couple of sea cows are needed to feed a native village for several months. Therefore, native villagers are not likely to hunt a lot of sea cows and cause the extinction.
	Secondly, although the reading passage contends that the number of kelps, the main food of sea cows, were possibly decreasing because of the environmental disturbance during that period and thus caused the lack of food as well as the extinction, the professor in the lecture points out that if the hypothesis is correct, other marine organisms like whales were also likely to be influenced, which is not the truth. In fact, according to the record from local fishing ships at that time, a decrease in whales has never been reported. Presumably, kelps also lived just fine around that time.
	Thirdly, contrary to the idea in the reading that it does make sense that the European fur traders have caused the extinction, for they killed the last sea cow and possessed a weapon that can kill a large number of sea cows quickly, the speaker suggests there is evidence that the number of sea cows had been already quite small about 100 years before, which is long before 1768. The speaker believes that there must be something that happened and caused the extinction, but not the fur traders who were the latest to come.

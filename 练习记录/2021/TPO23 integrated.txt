    Both the reading and the lecture are talking about the reasons that cause the population decrease of the yellow cedar. While the reading passage believes that the population decrease is caused by insects, bears and global warming, the professor suggests the 3 points are not adequate enough. 
    Firstly, the article claims that the insect parasites like cedar bark beetles are responsible to the phenomenon, for their larvae eat the wood. However, the professor thinks healthy yellow cedar can resist insects better than other trees——their bark and leaves are saturated with poisonal chemicals, and those yellow cedars killed by insects are just sick trees or trees about to die. Thus, the proposal is not the fundamental reason.
    Secondly, although the article suggests that bears can contribute to the population decrease, because bears sometimes claw at the cedars to eat the bark to get sugar and kill the cedars indirectly, the professor debates that yellow cedars live all across the mainland as well as the islands, and there is evidence that the cedars living on an island off the northwestern coast, where no bears appear, are also dying, which indicates that bears can't be the main factor. 
    Thirdly, contrary to the hypothesis that global warming makes cedars' roots grow in the late winter instead of the early spring and gets their roots frozen and damaged, the professor believes that the theory is contradicted to the previous observations. In fact, according to the observations, cedars at a lower elevation, which is actually warmer, are more likely to die compared with those at a high elevation which is cold. He notes that if the hypothesis is correct, the result would be the opposite one.

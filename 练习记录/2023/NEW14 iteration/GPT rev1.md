From my perspective, choosing to work for an established large company unquestionably offers more advantages than joining a small start-up, primarily because the experience gained here can play a pivotal role in shaping students' future careers.

Large companies, renowned for their standardized management practices and advanced technology, have the capacity to provide students with an in-depth understanding of their respective industries. For instance, working at a prominent smartphone manufacturer, which manages the **entire** production process of smartphones, **exposes** employees to **every facet of** the production pipeline. This includes involvement in the manufacturing of screens and other hardware components, circuit design, software engineering, and the implementation of operating systems. Acquiring technical expertise alongside management experience serves as a solid foundation for students who aspire to establish their own companies in the future. Even if they don't pursue entrepreneurship, they can acquire valuable insights into industry frontiers and further develop their expertise.

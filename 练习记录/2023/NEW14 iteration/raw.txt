From my perspective, choosing an established large company absolutely outweighs a small start-up, because the working experience here can play a crucial role in students' future career.
Large companies, usually famous for their standardized management and advanced technology, can provide students with a thorough insight of the industry. A large smartphone company, which encompasses the integrated process of manufacturing smartphones, for example, allows their employees to get in contact with each part of the pipeline such as the production of the screens and other hardware, the design of the circuits, the software engineering, and the implementation of the operation system. This technical knowledge, in conjunction with the management experience, offers students a basis for setting up their own company. Even if they don't run a business themselves, they can also learn a lot about the frontier and enhance their expertise.

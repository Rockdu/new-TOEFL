My suggestion, which may seem paradoxical at the first glance, for my country to address the housing shortage is to rise the housing price, because it prevents native residents from purchasing additional houses and encourages estate companies to construct more buildings. 
Price adjustment, in my opinion, is an effective economic approach to rebalance the relationship between the consumers and the sellers of the houses since it results immediately at nearly no cost. As the price increases, enterprises and capitals will be gradually attracted to the housing industry since it's more lucrative than before, and consumers will reconsider their decision and avoid unnecessary purchase for houses and apartments. Consequently, a higher price perfectly addresses the predicament by motivating the land developers and inhibiting the overheated estate market.

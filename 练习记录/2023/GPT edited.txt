In my perspective, teachers should evaluate students based on both their performance and the effort they invest. Relying solely on performance can lead to a dilemma where students might resort to unscrupulous practices.

I acknowledge that a student's performance, as the most direct indicator of their ability, should predominantly influence their score. However, overlooking the efforts students put in can inadvertently encourage dishonesty. When no value is placed on the effort exerted, students may be inclined to seek shortcuts, such as having someone from a higher grade complete their assignments for them, solely to achieve the best performance. This situation fosters an environment where cheating becomes the norm, detracting from the educational experience. Consequently, to truly enhance students' skills and cultivate their integrity, it is imperative to allocate a portion of the final score to those who demonstrate dedication and hard work.

In my view, the advantages of taking a gap year far outweigh the drawbacks. Contrary to common belief, a gap year is not a waste of time; in fact, it can be a time-saving investment.

It is crucial for prospective university freshmen to discover their true interests and find a major that ignites their passion. A gap year provides the ideal opportunity to achieve this. Through internships or enrolling in college courses beforehand, students can explore subjects and determine their affinity for them. Unfortunately, without such exploration, some students may enter university without a clear career plan, only to discover that their chosen major isn't suitable. This often leads to dropping out, incurring additional expenses, and wasting more time than if they had taken a gap year to explore their options.

In this essay, I argue that prioritizing the development of shopping malls and entertainment facilities over green spaces in urban areas, particularly those near the downtown area, is a more practical approach. While green spaces have their merits, several factors support the idea of utilizing city spaces for commercial purposes.

First and foremost, the maintenance of green parks within the city presents significant challenges due to the adverse effects of air pollution, particularly engine emissions from motor vehicles, which can hinder the survival of plants. Research has shown that high levels of pollution in urban environments can have detrimental effects on green spaces, making them less viable for recreation and relaxation.

Moreover, it's important to recognize that urban residents have alternative means of relaxation and leisure aside from spending time in green spaces. Establishing shopping malls and entertainment facilities not only provides a space for leisure but also stimulates local economies by encouraging consumption. This economic boost can result in increased job opportunities, higher tax revenues, and overall prosperity for the community.

While it's undeniable that green spaces have their own unique benefits, such as promoting mental well-being and contributing to environmental sustainability, it's crucial to consider the practical challenges they face in urban settings. By prioritizing shopping malls and entertainment facilities, city governments can strike a balance between meeting the recreational needs of their residents and fostering economic growth.

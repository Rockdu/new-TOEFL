From my perspective, Learning from computer games is absolutely not suitable for children, especially for those who are only 2 to 3 years old, because of both physical and mental health concerns.

The use of the computer damages kids' physical health in more than one way. Being sedentary in front of the screen will not only do harm to their eyes, which may further lead to shortsightedness, but will also raise the probability of suffering from obesity in the future due to the lack of exercise. Moreover, playing computer games also contribute to potential mental problems such as autism. The game is possibly to get the kids addicted and thus prevents them from communication activities, an ideal way for them to learn social skills.

From my perspective, despite the importance of the green space, rooms in the city, especially those near the downtown area, should be rather exploited to establish shopping malls and other entertaining facilities. 
First of all, it's more difficult to build and maintain a green park right inside the city since such air pollutant as engine emissions from the motors will set blocks to plants' survival. Besides, apart from hanging out in a garden or on a lawn, the residents can get themselves relaxed in other approaches, an ideal way among which is to go shopping. By establishing shopping malls, the governments can not only provide the citizens with a place to entertain, but also can they enhance the local economy by encouraging consumption.

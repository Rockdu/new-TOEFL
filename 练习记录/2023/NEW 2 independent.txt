From my perspective, teachers should evaluate students' score on both the performance and the effort paid. Because a mere judge from the performance will probably leads to a dilemma where students simply hand out the assignments to others and do other things instead.

I concede that the performance, which is the most direct factor that exhibits a student's ability, should decide the majority of the score. Nevertheless, ignoring the efforts paid encourages students to perform dishonesty. Since no one cares about the endeavor and every one focuses on the result, it's natural for most of the students to resort to a student from a higher grade to get the best performance, which will teach students nothing but cheating. Therefore, to truly improve students skills and develop their honesty, a portion of the final score should be given to those work harder.

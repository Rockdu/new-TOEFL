From my perspective, although journal writing brings some desirable benefits, its overall influence to students is negative because it largely consumes students' time and energy.
I acknowledge that journals can serve as an indicator of students' performance on grasping the ideas in class. Nevertheless, the cost is too high for an evaluation approach alone. Considering the difficulty of summarizing the general contents of a recent lesson, students have to spend extra time on the journals which could have been used to attend extra-curriculum activities to broaden their perspectives. Plus, compared to reviewing the points in a recent class repetitively, it's of greater significance for students to expose themselves to every aspect of the course by exploring the internet materials.

From my perspective, in order to attract more people to rural areas, governments should first build eligible hospitals in these areas, because the health issue is one of the fatal problems, without which other personal improvements and entertainments are meaningless.
In my country, where healthcare system develops slowly in the rural area, it's common for a rural family to move to a metropolis, where enumerous healthcare resources are gathered, for a simple surgery like dealing with a bad tooth as many villiages never own a qualified hospital. This greatly prevent citizens from moving to the rural areas, because as they age, they become more susceptible to heart diseases and other diseases that need immediate surgery. The dilemma here is, without nearby hospitals, one gets a heart attack has to be sent to an adjacent big city which usually takes hours, whereas he will probably die in few minutes. However, by establishing reliable hospitals, the residents' survival rates against these fatal diseases will be largely guaranteed, making the rural areas more attractive.

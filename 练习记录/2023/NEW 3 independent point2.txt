Among the one of the biggest environmental problems, in my opinion, is the marine pollution, given the fact that floating plastics and oil spills is detrimental to the maritime ecosystem.

The usage of diesel and oil not only brings human industrial revolutionary, but also leads to potential risks of environmental damages. The marine animals, especially those live in the area where human exploit fuel under sea, are put into a danger of being contaminated by the leaked oil, which is fatal to many marine creatures.

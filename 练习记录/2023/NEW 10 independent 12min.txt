From my perspective, for those remote regions, especially those not known by the public, promoting the tourism, despite some potential risks, is worth a try, because it's a great opportunity to improve the local economy and, moreover, will finally result in the improvement of other industries as well with a well-established transportation system that connects the region with other parts of the country.
The transportation convenience, together with the economic prosperity brought by tourism industry should never be underestimated. It is likely to finally benefit those remote regions because it allows the transportation of the raw materials and products. In other words, it allows the local companies to sell to and buy from other areas in the country and leads to a market spread. As the market expands from the locality to the whole nation, other businesses will also turn out to be more lucrative because they can operate at a larger scale.

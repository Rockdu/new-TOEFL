From my perspective, virtues of building relatively more green spaces far outweigh the drawbacks, because it's, although sounds paradoxical, a practical  and sustainable way to promote local economy.

As environmental conditions are generally deteriorating in many urban areas, nowadays, the young generation are growingly inclined to live in a suburb place connected with nature rather than a prosperous place with various pollution such as air and noise pollution in the downtown area. Green areas are likely to attract many young people to the region and thus benefit local industries by continuously bringing a large amount of human power there. Plus,  apart from human resources, the growth of population also comes with increasing number of demands, thereby expanding the market.

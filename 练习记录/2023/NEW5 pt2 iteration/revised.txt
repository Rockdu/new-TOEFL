From my perspective, the construction of green areas is among one of the key determinants to municipal development and should be prioritized by the city government. Abandoning building commercial facilities and embracing environment-friendly zones will, although seems paradoxical at the first place, in turn benefits the city's economy.
As the environmental problems is deteriorating fast in many urban areas, the new generation of the youth begin to reconsider their choice for a living place and start to value the environmental issues such as air pollution and noise pollution in the region. The city with parks in the living zones are attractive to the young people, since it not only refreshes the air nearby, but also serve as a natural oxygen bar where residents can relax themselves. Therefore, a large amount of human power will flow into the region and activate the local economy by both expanding the regional market and providing considerable laborers.


From my perspective, the virtues of creating more green spaces far outweigh the drawbacks. Paradoxically, it is a practical and sustainable approach to promoting the local economy.

In today's urban areas, environmental conditions are generally deteriorating. Consequently, the younger generation is increasingly inclined to live in suburban areas connected with nature rather than prosperous downtown locations plagued by various forms of pollution, such as air and noise pollution. Green areas possess the potential to attract a substantial number of young people to the region, thereby bolstering local industries with a consistent influx of human resources. Furthermore, in addition to the human resources, a growing population also brings an increase in demands, subsequently expanding the market.

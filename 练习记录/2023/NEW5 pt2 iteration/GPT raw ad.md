You're off to a good start in expressing your thoughts on the benefits of building more green spaces. Here are some points of advice and positive aspects of your expression:

1. **Vocabulary Use**: You've used some impressive vocabulary such as "virtues," "paradoxical," "inclined," and "human power." These words enhance your expression.

2. **Complex Sentence Structure**: Your sentences are well-structured and complex, which is great for demonstrating a strong command of the language.

3. **Clarity**: You make your point about the preference for suburban living over downtown areas due to environmental concerns clear and concise.

Now, let's continue with your discussion:

> "Green areas are likely to attract many young people to the region and thus benefit local industries by continuously bringing a large amount of human power there."

This sentence is well-constructed, but you can further improve it by specifying how these green areas attract young people. For example, you could mention recreational opportunities, clean air, or a sense of tranquility. This will provide a more vivid picture of the appeal.

> "Plus, apart from human resources, the growth of population also comes with increasing number of demands, thereby expanding the market."

This is a solid point. To enhance it, consider providing examples of the types of demands that increase with population growth. This could include the need for housing, services, and various goods.

The debate is about if establishing colonies on asteroids is a good idea. Although the author of the reading endorses this opinion with 3 points and regards it as the best solution, the professor in the listening, however, doesn't agree that it's a practical approach and demonstrated the downsides of the proposed 3 points.

While the reading values the low gravity of asteroids for the convenience it brings when spaceship lands on and takes off from those asteroids, the professor mentioned some potential risks that contribute to astronauts' physical health. Since some known risks, muscle mass decreasing and bone density dropping for example, have been detected on spacemen working on spaceships, astronauts heading to the asteroid colony may suffer from more serious damages.

Notwithstanding the author's assertion that companies sponsoring the project may not only can make ends meet but also have a chance to earn profits by selling rare elements and metals on the asteroids, the professor in the lecture is concerned about the plan's validity. First, apart from the excavation or mining, transportation expenditures and the cost of building colonies should also be taken into consideration, which are going to be astronomical and unaffordable. Second, if the companies keep selling those precious minerals and elements to earth, the value of those metals may decrease sharply due to the absence of their rarity because these materials are now easy to be found and not rare any more.

In contrary to the author's belief that the asteroids flying pass the earth are simple to reach and thus ameliorates the transportation difficulty, the professor refutes that the returning fee is probably not as cheap as the cost of reaching them. Many asteroids won't stay near the earth, instead, they fly away, possibly as far as Mars, after temporarily encountering the earth.

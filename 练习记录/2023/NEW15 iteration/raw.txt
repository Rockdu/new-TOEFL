From my perspective, the best approach for a company to retaining employees, which is far more than ameliorating only its work environment, is instead to foster a friendly atmosphere among colleagues, because positive interactions between employees give them a perfect feedback.
As most of the jobs are at least somewhat boring, an increasing number of clerks are seeking their passion in other aspects in the company, that is to communicate with their colleagues. For example, they may chat with colleagues about the daily life-movies to watch, restaurants to eat out and even their girlfriends or boyfriends-by which they are temporarily out of the grinding work affairs so that they can refuel themselves with energy.

From my perspective, a patronage from the governments to the electric car companies won't work because of two challenges, the immaturity of electric car related technologies and the indefinite way in which the companies will spend those extra money. 
First and foremost, contemporary products of electric cars are notorious for their incapability in terms of long-term traveling, which actually predominantly blocks most of the consumers from purchasing given that the majority of the families do travel to a distant tourist attraction once or twice a year. Besides, even if consumers can be induced to accept the shortage of electric cars by approaches like advertisements, it's difficult to tell whether the enterprises will spend the money on the industry of electric car since they may turn to some other more lucrative businesses.

I believe that judging teachers merely from their students' scores is injustice since it ignores other factors of the personal development. However, a committee of experienced teachers should be established to ensure a relatively objective evaluation.

On one hand, students' personal development is much more than academic performance. A policy depending on the test scores may encourage teachers to improve students' ability to get scores by terrifying or performing violence on students, which may deteriorate students' mental health. On the other hand, just as Kelly mentioned, a person's single visit to the classroom is hardly convincing and objective enough. Therefore, I suggest building a mechanism that every teacher's class should be visited regularly by multiple experienced teachers, and the final evaluation should comprise all the feedbacks.

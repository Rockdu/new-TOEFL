From my perspective, apart from training for employees' skills, there are many other valuable investments an employer should consider. For example, team building activities are also crucial since they improve the collaboration between different people and result in an effectively operating company.
I acknowledge that skillful employees are actually desirable team members, however, only when they have an awareness of teamwork, without which the individual aptitude is meaningless. Imagine a software company where all the clerks are expert programmers but only code in their own style instead of a standard uniform style defined by the whole company. It will be a disaster since no one is able to read and interpret others' codes and the whole project will be consequently stuck, leading to a huge loss of the company. Therefore, I advocate building the team in the first place before skill training.

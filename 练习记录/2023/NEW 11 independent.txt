I think expanding the living zone in the suburbs is a resonable decision. However, I disagree with Paul in terms of the building that should be constructed-the government should not focus on houses, but should build more apartments and the most importantly, the infrastructures as well. Blocks of houses require way more lands when compared with apartments to contain a certain number of people. This may deeply impact the agriculture, since arable fields that could grow crops are occupied by houses and therefore end up wasted. Additionally, the commuting problem could be easily solved with a repertoire of infrastructures around the living area, especially the public transportation system. For instance, many of the giant city in the world like Tokyo and New York run a plenty of metro lines under the ground, ameliorating the inconvenience caused by the long distance from home to the company.

From my perspective, people are going to embrace extremely short working hours due to the prosperity of artificial intelligence industries, because many jobs will be distributed to robots, which have already become significantly efficient tools in many realms nowadays.
Recent years have seen the rapid development of AI technology. The evolution of AI from singlemodal to multimodal, from single-task to multi-task has demonstrated the great potential of AI, indicating a new era ahead. They are gradually becoming a complex system just like us human, and have already taken the place of many employees. Specifically, Diffusion models together with GPT series have already replaced those painters and writers who are not skillful enough. Therefore, in the near future, predictably, the number of companies that recruit AI crews as alternatives is going to keep ascending, resulting in a future where people are able to abandon all sorts of jobs and enjoy the life.

I think it's necessary to incorporate field trips into the frame of a child's education, as long as the frequency strictly controlled.
The trips could get students refreshed, and rid them of the heavy courseworks in the school temporally, which is especially important for their mental health. With the heavy courseworks in the school, children may find it boring to go to the school and develop a hate for study, and a journey to a museum or an art gallery provides them with a fresh way to acquire knowledge. Plus, the problem mentioned by Kelly could be simply settled by controlling the frequency of the trip. I mean, it doesn't harm that much to spend a couple of days on the preparation for a meaningful and rewarding trip or two each semester, is it?

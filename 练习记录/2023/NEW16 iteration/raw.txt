From my perspective, the virtues of journal writing certainly outweigh its drawbacks, because it offers students an opportunity to review and summarize the knowledge they've learned. 
As researches have successfully demonstrated that the short-term memories is volatile without proper reinforcement, we have to face the scientific truth that by no means can students memorize every content learned on the class. Their journals actually serve as important materials that enable them to extract essential parts from the courses and to review core contents by getting an in-depth understanding of them. Journals will largely facilitate students' learning progress, especially when they're preparing for their final exam, since they can quickly review the points by browsing all their previous summaries.

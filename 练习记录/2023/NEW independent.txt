I agree that employee training is among the most significant investments a company should take into consideration. Not only to attract new staffs, but also, which may seem paradoxical at the first place, to save expenditures for the team. 
Although being valued by others is one of the main concerns that attract the employees, the skill improvement itself could also be intriguing. People with potential to succeed are often not satisfied with the status quo and are consistently seeking for enhancement. Therefore, a company that offers precious chances and pays effort to plan for their employees' future career would be more preferable to these people. Plus, in my opinion, Andrew may have ignored an important fact, that is a highly skilled staff would require a higher salary at the beginning, which probably outweighs the cost spent on training. So, why not recruit them at a lower price and then guide them to become a more skillful and more sticky crew?

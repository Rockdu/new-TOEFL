From my perspective, the construction of a company cafeteria should be a top priority to retain employees because it serves as a vital space for staff to rejuvenate themselves after long periods of work.

Having meals, which often take place within the company's premises, offers employees an ideal break opportunity, considering that meals typically fall between shifts. During these meal breaks, employees can engage in conversations with their colleagues on non-work-related topics, providing a mental respite. Additionally, it's crucial for workers to replenish their energy levels to maintain efficiency in subsequent shifts. Therefore, a comfortable dining environment, coupled with access to a nutritious diet provided by the cafeteria, becomes imperative.

From my perspective, the company should prioritize the construction of its cafeteria in order to retain its employees because the cafeteria is an important place for staff in the company to refresh themselves after a long-time working period.
Having meals, which usually occurs in the companies' working campus, is an ideal way for a break since people have meals between working shifts. During the meal time, employees can chat with their colleagues about some topics irrelevant to work affairs to relax their minds. Plus, workers have to replenish themselves with energy so that they're able to continue to work efficiently in the next shift. Therefore, a confortable eating environment, in conjunction with a healthy diet provided by the cafeteria is necessary.

From my perspective, the cafeteria in the company is among the predominant concerns of retaining employees, because having a meal in the cafeteria allows them to rejuvenate themselves between intensive working hours.
Amid compact working shifts are lunch hours and dinner time, which provides employees with both physical and mental relaxation. An easy chat with colleagues, especially those about daily life, temporarily rid them of work-related affairs like their annoying leaders or some mistakes in a certain project. Therefore, the casual communication there in the cafeteria ameliorates their mental stress. Plus, to ensure an energetic status in the subsequent tasks, employees have to refuel themselves with foods. Given the advantages mentioned above, the cafeteria is of greate significance and should be valued.

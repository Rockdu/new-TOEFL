The salinity of the Salton Sea, a salty inland lake, keeps ascending for years because the evaporation of its water outweighs the supplying input from the rain and rivers, resulting in the failure to support fauna there including fishes and birds. The author of the reading proposed several solutions to reduce the concentration of the salt, while the professor in the listening doesn't agree with the ideas.

Contrary to the author who argues that it's possible to remove the salt in desalination facilities and the byproduct refuse can be left behind safely, the professor thinks it may cause health issues to local animals and residents. The debris of the process, which has been mentioned in the article by 'other materials', is in fact toxic commonly, and as these toxic chemicals brought by the wind into the air, animals and local citizens are likely to breathe them, the toxic matters may cause serious health issues, in.

Notwithstanding the plan in the text to dilute the lake water with the water from the Pacific Ocean which is nearly 20% less salty, the professor claims that the expenditures for building pipes and canals are too high since it's about 1km distant from the Pacific Ocean to the lake. The goverment seems not able to afford these huge costs.

Although the wall project, which divide the lake into sections and only controls the salinity in the large section by freshwater from rivers nearby, sounds reasonable at first, the professor points out that it won't work due to some special geological concerns. Because the Salton Sea is located at a place where such geological activities as earthquakes frequently occur, the walls will be destroyed soon after the construction by those activities and as the walls break the water will flow back to its original places and end up mix together again.

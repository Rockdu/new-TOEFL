The reading and the lecture are both about a European silver silver coin discovered at a Native American site. While the author of the reading thinks the coin was placed there recently to mislead scholars, the professor in the lecture asserts that the coin is genuine and serves as an important evidence of Norse's travel to America.

The author's believes that since the remains of norse sites are found in distant eastern Canada, which is a thousand kilometers away from the Maine site where Native American once lived, the coin has nothing to do with the Norse settlements. However, the professor in the lecture doesn't think it's convincing, given that Native Americans might travel to the Norse settlements, according to some related evidence, and were possible to take the coins there back to their own places. Besides, Native Americans are interested in other places and love traveling, further enhancing the possibility.

Notwithstanding the absence of other coins, which is the fact demonstrated by the reading, the professor in the listening mentioned that the sites of Norse explorers are actually not permanent and they may pack the coins when they're leaving America. Therefore, the coins were probably brought back to Europe at that time, leading to the absence.

Although the author debates that silver coins were useless at that time in North America and thus there was no need to bring them from Europe to America, the professor in the lecture claims that Native Americans appreciate unusual items, which makes it possible for Norse explorers to trade silver coins. As silver coins represents some aesthetic functions, being made into jewelry for example, Native Americans are likely to barter valuable things for the coins.

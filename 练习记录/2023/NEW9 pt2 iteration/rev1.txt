From my perspective, financial support for electric car companies is an ideal plan since it is actually the only way leading to a environmentally friendly future. 
While establishing public transportation system may effectively address the short-term crises, it fails to prevent us from running into an unavoidable predicament in the distant future, where the earth will become overpopulated and the large scale inner conbustion engine based public transportation will keep contaminating the fragile ecosystem. It turns out that we aren't making substantial strides in environment protection. Nevertheless, patronizing the development of the vehicles utilizing green energy offers an alternative for contemporary motor engines, therefore propels us towards a possible carbon-neutral future.

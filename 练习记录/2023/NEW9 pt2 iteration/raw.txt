From my perspective, patronizing electric car companies is a better solution since replacing motor vehicles with the electric version is the only way towards an environment-friendly future.
The prosperity of public transportation, admittedly, is a reasonable plan for short-term crisis. However, it fails to prevent climate from deteriorating due to its neglection of a possible distant future, a future when earth is overpopulated and massive public transporation is still one of the predominant factors of climate change. Therefore, as long as motors are used as an approach to commuting, climate dilemma is impossible to be radically fixed. In contrast, allocating fundings to industries that invent vehicles utilizing green energy will lead human to a sustainable thrive as it finds an alternative for motor engines and truly fixes the problem.

From my perspective, supporting electric car companies is a superior solution, as transitioning to electric vehicles represents the most viable path toward an environmentally friendly future. 

While the promotion of public transportation is a reasonable short-term strategy to address certain crises, it fails to address the long-term environmental concerns that stem from a future characterized by overpopulation and continued reliance on traditional modes of transportation. In such a future, massive public transportation systems can still contribute significantly to climate change. Consequently, as long as internal combustion engines remain the primary means of commuting, it is improbable that we can make substantial strides in rectifying our climate predicament.

In contrast, allocating resources and investments to industries that develop vehicles powered by green energy sources offers a more sustainable path forward. This approach seeks to replace conventional motor engines with greener alternatives, effectively addressing the root of the problem and ultimately propelling us towards a more sustainable and thriving future.

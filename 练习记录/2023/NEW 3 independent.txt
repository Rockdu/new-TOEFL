From my point of view, the virtue of taking a gap year significantly outweighs the drawbacks. A gap year is definitely not a waste of time, and may contradictorily save one's time.
It's vital for a candidate freshman of the university to first figure out his true interest, the major he could put his passion on, and the gap year is a perfect opportunity to decide that. By doing internships or learning college courses previously, a student is able to tell whether he likes the subject or not. If. unfortunately, a student never think of his interested realm and never have a career plan for the future, he may end up finding the major not suitable and quitting the university, which is likely to cost both more money and longer time compared to taking a gap year.

From my perspective, the working hour is not likely to be shortened after 20 years, despite huge leap of the science and technology. The reason lies is that apart from the potential advances of the sci-tech, people's demands will also grow in the following 20 years, in fact, even faster. 

I acknowledge that our society is likely to consistently develop in the near future, especially given the story happened at the end of the last century when plants and enterprises mushroomed, leading to unbelievable global prosperity. However, as the productivity improves, people's requirements for the life also improve. Few decades ago when smartphone was still something rare, having an iphone is considered luxurious, while nowadays, having multiple smartphones, perhaps due to the need for work, is nothing to brag about. Therefore, manufacturers are required to produce more smartphones to meet the additional demands, which will bring the staff there additional working hours.

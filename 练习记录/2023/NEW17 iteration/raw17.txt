From my perspective, the virtues of an optional-attendance policy unquestionably outweigh its drawbacks and flaws, because it not only allows students to utilize their time and energy efficiently.
Many classes, especially those with multiple meetings a week, put exceedingly much pressure on students, thus preventing them from learning anything by taking up time originally used for reflection and summarization, which are critical steps during learning to foster students' own interpretation of the knowledge. Plus, some professors, although not many, are proficient in doing research but are poor in running an actual course. Under a circumstance akin to this, it's better for students to turn to website opening courses when it comes to learning new knowledge and discuss the problems, especially those tricky ones, they meet in the learning process with the professor.

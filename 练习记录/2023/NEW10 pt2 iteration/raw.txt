From my perspective, reckless promotion of the tourism in remote regions will rather render the residents here a disaster than benefit them, because the exposure to the visitors may pose high pressure to them and thus damage the local culture.
Every coin has two sides, so does the prosperity of tourism, which not only brings economy boom, but also incurs potential alternations of local culture. After the region is transformed into a tourist attraction, local inhabitants are going to be busy with the tourism affairs. For example, they have to run retailing stores, restaurants, and recreational facilities in order to build a standard tourist spot and make profits, probably indicating them relinquishing their original lifestyle.

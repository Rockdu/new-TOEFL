From my perspective, the virtues of educational computer games outweigh the drawbacks, since they transformed the learning process into a form more acceptable for young children and will likely to contribute to kids' interest in studying.
The most obvious problem blocking kids from learning at an early age, in my opinion, is actually the lack of interest. Studying is so boring, especially when compared with other activities like catching an insect or chasing each other on the lawn, in an infant's or a child's world. Educational games can largely eliminate the monotony and foster the attractiveness of learning by interpreting knowledge in a recreational way. Consequently, children are more likely to perform well in their future study due to the interest cultivated by the games.

From my point of view, the most significant impact of the invention of TV, is the cohesiveness it brings to humanity confronting the global problems, because it offers people on-going campaigns and events through news reports and raise their awareness of global issues.
TV brings us together by spreading sensational, maybe sometimes even notorious, events, and may further advocate us to buttress those campaigns together in justice. For example, notwithstanding the prosperity in many regions in the world, many countries, especially those in a smaller scale, are actually suffering from poverty, food shortage and even wars, which we could have never known without the widespread televised news. As public awareness raised, people from around the world strive to address these issues by going on a parade or establishing related organizations to prevent these bad news from making further strides.

TV can bring us together by spreading sensational, maybe sometimes even notorious, affairs. It also plays an important role in further prompting us to contribute to solving those predicaments. For example, notwithstanding the prosperity of many regions in the world, many other countries, especially those smaller ones, are actually suffering from poverty, food shortage and wars, which we could have never known without the widespread televised news. As public awareness keeps rising, people from around the world strive to address these issues by going on a parade or establishing related organizations to prevent these bad news from making further strides.

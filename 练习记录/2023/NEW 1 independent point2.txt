From my perspective, the best strategy to attract people to live in the rural area should be building infrastructures that facilitate residents' life, e.g. the electric facilities, because the predominant factor that prevents people from moving to the rural area, in my opinion, is the inconvenience of the daily life there.
As far as I'm concerned, even now, many countryside areas are in fact facing the problems of electricity shortage in my country, which is fatal since it disables the usage of such electrical device as electrical ovens, televisions, smartphones and computers. Without those productive tools, it's more difficult to deal with the routines. What's even worse is it's hard to keep up with the fast developing world without the communication gadgets such as phones and laptops.

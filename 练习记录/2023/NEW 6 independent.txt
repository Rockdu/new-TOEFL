In my opinion, it's literally extravagant to spend much on the training of employees. The company should rather prioritize the investment to the projects themselves since the projects are the predominant factors that decide the survival of the company. 
The philosophy of the merchandise, which also includes expanding the market and attracting customers from my perspective, is way more than only developing skillful staff. It's not a wise choice to move the investment from marketing to training programs not only because the employers can simply hire more capable employees, but also for the security of continuous development, a factor especially critical during the economic depression. With the saved expenditures of which are originally used to train employees, the enterprise is more likely to survive under the heavy burden of the loan and the inactive market.

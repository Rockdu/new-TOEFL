	Both the passage and the lecture are about the function of the triceratops frill. The passage suggests 3 possible functions of the frill while the lecture refutes all the 3 theories and points out the problems. 
	First, although the reading claims that the frill may be able to defend triceratopses, which is supported by frequently discovered holes and damages in the frill, the professor disagrees by questioning the true cause of these holes. The damages caused by fighting, provided by the professor, are curable and would leave special healing scars, but none of the special scars is detected, suggesting the holes may be rather the product of bone disease. Thus, the evidence in the passage is too weak to assert the defence function of the frill.
	Second, the author proposes that the frill may plays an important role in mating process, where the frill is filled with blood and turn bright, by providing the fact that the frill probably contains blood vessels. However, the professor doubts the inference, since the blood vessels seem to be developed early in the frill of a young triceratops who doesn't need to mate. If the reading is correct, the blood vessels in the frill are expected not to begin to form until the sexual maturity. 
	Third, the passage states that the frill may contribute to lengthened jaw muscles, allowing the triceratopses to gain more chewing power to deal with tough food. On the contrary, the professor hold a different view that lengthened muscles are not necessarily beneficial-when pulling, long muscles may be less efficient than a shorter one. Also, many animals like elephants possesses suprising biting power but are with short jaw muscles. What's more, the professor mentions that weak muscles would rather be a potential danger, because they're exposed to the air and could be easily attacked by enemies like predators. Generally speaking, the frill seems not for enlarged jaw muscles which is hard to regard firmly as an advantage.
